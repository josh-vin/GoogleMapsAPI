# Commute Times
Simple script I wrote to help me track the commute times from home to work and work to home during the week. 

## API Access
To set up API with Google Maps go to this website: 

https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=profound-alcove-424200-v6

And set up an API key that you can set in the code.
